# Smart Health Card Scanning Application

This application was built to assist in the scanning, reading, and verifing of Smart Health Cards (SHC). It allows individuals to test their created SHC's for validity as well as allows those who have been provided SHC's the ability to see what information is contained within them. 

You have three options for this application: a traditional QR scanner, a file uploader that will parse a picture of your QR code that you have saved on the device, or the .smart-health-card file itself. These three options cover the main ways a user might want to interact/utilize their SHC.

# EVERYTHING IS DONE IN THE BROWSER. NOTHING IS SENT TO A SERVER AND NO DATA IS STORED ANYWHERE. THIS APPLICATION HAS NO INTENTION OF TAKING YOUR DATA BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.
